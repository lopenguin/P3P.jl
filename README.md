# P3P.jl

A minimal package for solving P3P problems in Julia.

```Julia
pkg> add https://github.com/lopenguin/P3P.jl
```

## How to use
TODO

## Solvers
Currently only the [Nanako solver](https://github.com/g9nkn/p3p_problem/tree/main) is implemented. It is a direct method and ported from the [MATLAB code](https://github.com/g9nkn/p3p_problem/blob/main/p3p_nakano_bmvc2019.m) released by the author.

Contributions welcome! The Nanako solver is enough for my needs, and I hope releasing my implementation is useful for you.
